Located in Gijduvon district of Bukhara region, our workshop has been creating and restoring traditional musical instruments since 1996, while passing on this timeless art to younger generations. Master Islom Khudoyberdiyev — a craftsman with over 40 years of experience — has devoted his life to preserving and enriching the sound of national music.

In our workshop, instruments such as dutor, tanbur, rubab, chang, oud, qanun, nay, and doira are handcrafted with great precision and care. Each instrument embodies the spirit, artistry, and history of the Uzbek people.

Master Islom not only creates masterpieces himself but also continues the tradition through more than 40 students, who now work independently across the country, sharing the skills and inspiration learned from their teacher.

The workshop is not just a place of work — it is a school of dedication and artistry. Every instrument born here carries the warmth of the craftsman’s hands and transforms into a voice of the heart.`,
